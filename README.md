# common-collection-operations
Developers always face a situation where they have multiple collections and need to perform common set operations on those collections.
The motivation behind this project is that we can perform common mathematical set operations of Java collections with ease.

This module will compute Union, Intersection and check for subset (mathematical set operaions) on two given collections. 
The input collections can have different implementaions i.e. developer can perform these operations between a List and a Set and can also configure the implementation of the resultant collection.
By default it will de-dup the elements and return the ArrayList of computation result.
